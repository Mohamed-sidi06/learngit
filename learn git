know we generate a key ssh and add it to the ssh of github : 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "mo.sidi.239@gmail.com"



ssh-keygen -t -rsa -b 4096 -c "mo.sidi.239@gmial.com"


ssh-keygen: This command is used to generate SSH key pairs.
-t rsa: Specifies the type of key to generate, in this case, RSA.
-b 4096: Sets the key length to 4096 bits. Larger key lengths offer increased security but take longer to generate.
-C "mo.sidi.239@gmail.com": Adds a comment to the key, typically an email address used for identification purposes.

we were talking about if we want to start a file in an existing reposit ; but wht if want to add an exesting folder from vscode to my git :
first go the folder that we want to add and tap : 
					don't forget to add the file and to commit it to the repos .
			1)git init
Imagine you have a folder on your computer that contains all your project files. By running "git init" inside that folder, you're creating a special place where Git can store information about your project's history and changes. 
			2)git remote add origin (URL of the repository  taht you create) .
			3)how to verified : 
				you can verified by taping : 
				git -v : 
				push :
				fetch :  mean it's succed 
			4)git push -u origin main : 


---------------------------------------
					"  git branch "
				a brinch represent an independent line of developpement 
		how to create a branche : 
			git checkout -b branche1 
						craet a new branch called branch1
		to check all the brinch : 
			git branch 
--------------------------------------------------
					"	git merge " 
				merge use to upload a file frome a branche to the branche master 
		you can create a branche from a branche . 
		but to avoid the conflict we must use : 
		an app called : Diffmerge
		then tap :  
					git mergetool
		this commed will show you three part : 
		in left you will the branch taht we want to merge it(merge2) . 
		in the right you wil see the the first merge  (merge1)
